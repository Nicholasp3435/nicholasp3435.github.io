                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things in the world is birds! I was inspired by products like 
                    Bird Buddy, which is a camera-equipped bird feeder, but I wanted a version that 
                    could be live-streamed so <em>anyone</em> could watch my feeder &mdash; something 
                    Bird Buddy doesn't support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already had a home server, so I decided to stream a webcam feed using a Raspberry 
                    Pi 4 with Wi-Fi. This allowed the webcam to be portable and not rely on long cables.
                    I housed both the Pi and webcam in separate weatherproof boxes so the camera could
                    reach tighter spaces where the Pi wouldn't fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some trial and error, I got FFmpeg running on the Pi to stream video to the 
                    server. The server hosts the stream using HLS segments and also runs motion 
                    detection to identify bird activity.
                </p>

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A good video stream balances bitrate and resolution.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Think of a large canvas drawn quickly in pen &mdash; big doesn't always 
                                mean better!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        FFmpeg is a very useful tool for anything video related; it can even offload to 
                        GPU for higher performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HLS is a low-latency, memory-efficient way to serve video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Brown Thrashers are very messy eaters!

                </div>

                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Where UGA is the result of a team project for a Web Programming course. We were 
                    given a prompt to create a React web application that serves to help UGA. A 
                    friend and I assembled a team with two others to create an app to search and 
                    upload on campus amenities such as bathrooms or vending machines. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of our Web Programming course, we used React with Next.js. We started 
                    with Figma mockups of the app. We designed a home page, two views of the map 
                    page (one for each logged in and logged out users), a registration page, and 
                    a login page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then split up, each doing separate tasks for the app. Some of us made React 
                    components for each of the pages and others managed a MongoDB database for 
                    storing user accounts and user submitted amenities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, we presented our app to the class with a little sketch! I was
                    running late to class, but I needed my morning iced coffee! If only somebody
                    knew where the nearest vending machine with coffee was! We then proceeded to
                    show the features of logged out and logged in users of the app. We got
                    1<sup>st</sup> in the class vote for best presentation! Probably because of my
                    iced coffee.
                </p>

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        React with Next.js is quite versatile, being able to do many things that 
                        would be more difficult to do with standard HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figma is an excellent tool for design planning &mdash; stopping to plan out
                        designs saved us a lot of time in the long run.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MongoDB cloud is very helpful with dealing with multiple users; a central
                        database is much easier to work with than local ones.
                    </li>
