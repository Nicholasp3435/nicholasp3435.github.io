                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of my favorite things in the world is birds! I was inspired by products
                        like Bird Buddy, a bird feeder with a built-in camera, to make my own such product!
                        The main reason is that I wanted to be able to live-stream my bird feeder so 
                        that <em>anyone</em> can watch; something Bird Buddy doesn't support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I already have a permanent home server, so I decided I could use a Raspberry
                        Pi to connect to the server to host a webcam. Wi-Fi allows the webcam and Pi
                        to be portable and not rely on long cables. I housed both the Pi and webcam
                        in separate weatherproof boxes so the webcam can reach tighter spots that the
                        Pi wouldn't fit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first time using any Raspberry Pi, but it was just like any other
                        computer. I put Ubuntu Server on the Pi and I can easily SSH into it as needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this is where tragedy struck! I originally got a Pi 3B+, thinking that
                        the CPU and RAM were good enough for steaming. Upon testing, the Pi can't handle
                        even 480p without the USB bus not being able to support the current needed by
                        the webcam; USB 2.0 on the Pi 3B+ is not enough for a stable video.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried lots of software solutions like trying to limit the amount of background
                        processes on the Pi so the power could be available for USB. After a little 
                        research on forum threads, I found the problem is hardware; the Pi 3B+ just has
                        an inherit USB instability. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thank goodness I kept the receipt because I exchanged the Pi 3B+ for a Pi 4B. 
                        After nervously watching the video stream, it seemed stable enough to call it 
                        stable at 720p! It <em>can</em> do 1080p, but then the bitrate and quality really
                        drops so i just found out about this word and i'm not planning on using it anytime
                        soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After some trial and error, I got FFmpeg running on the Pi to stream video to 
                        the server. The server hosts the stream using HLS segments as well as stores 24 
                        hours of archived video. At night, the server can run a motion detection 
                        algorithm to detect bird activity and store bird visitors in a permanent 
                        archive.
                    </p>

                            A good video stream balances bitrate and resolution.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Think of a large canvas drawn quickly in pen; big doesn't 
                                    always mean better!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            FFmpeg is a very useful tool for anything video related; it can even offload 
                            to GPU for higher performance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            HLS is a low-latency and memory-efficient way to serve live videos.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Working with hardware is much more different than software. There is much
                            more to consider than just slapping a Pi in a box and calling it a day.

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        Where UGA is the result of a team project for a Web Programming course. We were 
                        given a prompt to create a React web application that serves to help UGA. A 
                        friend and I assembled a team with two others to create an app to search and 
                        upload on campus amenities such as bathrooms or vending machines. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of our Web Programming course, we used React with Next.js. We started 
                        with Figma mockups of the app. We designed a home page, two views of the map 
                        page (one for each logged in and logged out users), a registration page, and 
                        a login page. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then split up, each doing separate tasks for the app. Some of us made React 
                        components for each of the pages and others managed a MongoDB database for 
                        storing user accounts and user submitted amenities. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result of our hard work is an app where users can view pins of on campus 
                        amenities provided by registered users. Any user can provide an email address
                        and password to create their own custom pins! The data is hashed and stored
                        using a MongoDB Cloud server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, we presented our app to the class with a little sketch! I was
                        running late to class, but I needed my morning iced coffee! If only somebody
                        knew where the nearest vending machine with coffee was! We then proceeded to
                        show the features of logged out and logged in users of the app. We got
                        1<sup>st</sup> in the class vote for best presentation! Probably because of my
                        iced coffee.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            React with Next.js is quite versatile, being able to do many things that 
                            would be more difficult to do with standard HTML.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Figma is an excellent tool for design planning. Stopping to plan out
                            designs saved us a lot of time in the long run.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MongoDB Cloud is very helpful with dealing with multiple users; a central
                            database is much easier to work with than local ones.
                        </li>

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        Apoli Systems is the term project for my Software Engineering course. This project
                        is of me and four others with the task to create a cinema e-booking
                        system. We were to create both a user and admin frontend, a backend, and a 
                        database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was the frontend team lead where we started with a mix of paper and Figma
                        prototyping. I wasn't too familiar with Figma at the time, so I stuck with 
                        paper for a little bit before another team member showed me how to use it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was also before any of the team knew React, so the entire site is plain old
                        HTML, JS, and CSS. The backend used Node.js and the database is a locally hosted
                        MongoDB database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the development of the project, we learned lots about Software
                        Engineering. Things like UML diagrams, SOLID principles, different architectural
                        designs, and working as a team were all taught alongside development. I do wish
                        we were taught some things <em>before</em> major code development, but now I 
                        know for the future!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result of the term project is an cinema e-booking system aimed for two sets 
                        of users: users who want to buy movie tickets, and admins managing the movies.
                        Those who want to watch movies can view available films and select a showtime
                        before selecting seats. Users must be logged in to purchase tickets, so if one
                        isn't, the system will redirect to the login page where they can login/register.
                        On registration, the system will hash and store credentials in a MongoDB 
                        database. After the user is logged in, they are able to purchase tickets. On
                        purchasing tickets, the system will store the selected seats in the database as
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any admins who logs in will automatically be redirected to the admin panel, 
                        where they can manage the current movies, current promotions, and current users.
                        An admin is able to create, update, and delete movies and showtimes. They are 
                        also able to create, update, and delete promotions for movies. An admin is able
                        to send a promotional emails to all users. Finally, an admin is able to promote
                        a general user to an admin. Everything is stored in a MongoDB database.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Working as a team is very efficient, so long as everyone does their part and
                            communicates any issues. We struggled a little bit in the beginning with 
                            communication, but we all got in the swing of things quickly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also took on a role of a version controller; I managed the GitHub 
                            repository. This was the first time I had managed a repo for more than just
                            myself. I found it to be very useful having many different branches for each 
                            task. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the frontend team lead, I had to coordinate with the backend team to make
                            sure that what we are doing in the front is simple to connect in the back. I
                            also had to manage frontend related timelines and tasks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although slightly indirectly, I learned some of Node.js and MongoDB from the
                            backend team.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When done right, sometimes all you need is pure HTML, JS, and CSS!

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        As part of a take-home interview project for the University of Georgia's
                        Small Satellite Research Lab, I was tasked with hiding a text message inside
                        a PNG image without visibly altering it. The task was split into making two
                        programs: an encoder and decoder. The biggest requirement was that the 
                        message must be encoded in such a way so that the decoder can detect errors,
                        bonus points if the decoder can correct errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first did some research about hiding text inside of images. During the
                        research, I found this general process is called steganography. I then read
                        the wikipedia article of common
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_steganography_techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        steganography techniques</a>; I found least 
                        significant bit (LSB) encoding to be a pretty simple. LSB encoding is 
                        using the LSB to hide data. As a decimal example, to hide the number 89 in 
                        the number 614058, use the number 6140<u>89</u>. Since it is changing the
                        LSB, the overall number doesn't change too much. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, I had to deal with how to encode error detection with optional 
                        correction. Thankfully, I was ahead of the game and already know a simple
                        solution: Hamming Codes! Before this project, I watched Grant Sanderson's 
                        (3Blue1Brown)
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/X8jsijhllIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        video about Hamming Codes</a>. In it, Sanderson explained Hamming Codes with 
                        Hamming(15,&nbsp;11) codes. I wanted to use something similar, but I didn't 
                        want to use 15 bits since that would cause a lot more image distortion. I
                        also wanted to be able to store 8 bits (1 character) and total length to be 
                        divisible by 4 so that it can evenly be split in four channels for each 
                        pixel. A way to use 4 bits for parity would be super useful. I had a feeling
                        it is very similar to how Sanderson explained with Hamming(15,&nbsp;11) 
                        codes. A small bit of research for Hamming(12,&nbsp;8) codes provided a 
                        useful
                        <a href="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2506/Fall2013/Notes/L21.ErrorCodes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        result</a> which showed, yes, it is very similar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I finally had to decide how to manipulate image data pixel by pixel. I 
                        researched and found two common PNG libraries: libpng and stb. I chose 
                        <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        stb</a> because, frankly, it looked a lot more simple to setup and use 
                        compared to libpng.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I knew what to do, I just had to do it! The encoding program will 
                        read an input message file and an input PNG file. It will then apply 
                        Hamming(12,&nbsp;8) codes to each character in the message. Finally, it will
                        write each character into each pixel of the image file and save it as a new
                        image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decoding program is similar, just reversed. It reads an input encoded 
                        PNG file. Then, it will extract the character from each pixel, applying any
                        error corrections if needed. Finally, it writes the message to a new file.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This was my first C project, so I learned a lot about how C differs from
                            Java.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are lot more error detection and correction algorithms than 
                            Hamming Codes, but they are more complicated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Steganography is a still a thing in common practice and can hide a lot 
                            more than just text data in images.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Doing manual memory management in C isn't as scary as it sounds!

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        Not all my projects are about computers; I have other interests! I really enjoy
                        analogue photography, so I tried my hand at making my own film camera! I was
                        inspired by Brian Haidet's (AlphaPhoenix) <a href="https://youtu.be/ewQQX3fxQKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        video on cyanotypes</a> to try to make my own!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I own a 3D printer and have experience in Fusion 360, I figured it wouldn't
                        be too hard to model and print a camera from scratch. The "film" could be made
                        from cyanotype chemicals and printmaking paper from craft stores. The only part
                        I didn't make was the glass lenses that I had bought on ebay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before committing to a 3D model, I first prototyped with a shoebox! Believe 
                        it or not, that shoebox was able to take photographs by just taping a lens to 
                        the front of it and having a cyanotype on the back! Ultimately, prototyping
                        allowed me to do quick and rough testing to get a general idea of how a fully
                        printed camera could be like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reviewing some simple optics formulas and considering some of my experience
                        from actual photography, I modeled a camera that could be printed and be put
                        together. The lens allows for focusing a working distance from 1.5 meters to
                        infinity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all is said and done, I can capture photographs using the camera! Cyanotypes
                        are only sensitive to UVA light, so photos can only be taken with sunlight or
                        with artificial blacklights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest drawback to cyanotypes is that the effective ISO is super low, and
                        even with a 4 inch aperture, it still takes an exposure time on the order of 
                        a few hours to get a decent image.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is value in spending a little time for prototyping. I had a completely
                            different idea of how I wanted to design the camera before testing with a 
                            shoebox. Needless to say, if a shoebox can take pictures, I didn't need to 
                            complicate the camera model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allowing a design to have flexibilty is better than having fixed components.
                            This applies to lots of things in the world from programming to 3D modelling.

                            Cameras are not the hard part, photography is.

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        Let's get something out of the way first: Linear algebra is a very powerful tool!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started making this after my linear algebra class. We learned a lot about vectors
                        and transformations. One thing that stuck to me were rotation transformations, 
                        though we only learned about the 2D rotation matrix. I went out of my way to learn
                        the 3D rotation (and attempted to learn 4D rotation) matrices. A friend told me how
                        these kind of transformations is how computers render 3D objects. I suddenly had
                        inspiration to make a 3D object viewer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The .OBJ file type is very easy to parse, as it is just a list of the vertices and
                        faces of the model. I made a OBJReader class to read and parse .OBJ files into Vertex
                        and Face object arrays. I harnessed the power of linear algebra and made some utility
                        classes, Matrix and Vector, to perform transformations. That's right, I wanted to
                        code all the math myself and not use a premade library. I didn't learn all the math
                        for nothing; besides, it helps me to know what's going on under the hood anyway. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After making the utility classes, I made a loop to go through each face and transform
                        the vectors associated with it and then draw the face. Each vector gets rotated
                        about the X, Y, and Z axis; gets translated about the X, Y, and Z axis, gets perspective
                        transformed, and then gets projected onto the XY plane to be rendered on the screen. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's it! Just transform all the vectors and display it by connecting them together!
                        I made a GUI and then mouse controls to view the model. I also made the model load
                        a z distance away so that it automatically loads with the full model in view. The user
                        can rotate about the X and Y axis by dragging the primary mouse button and can translate
                        about the XY plane by dragging the secondary mouse button. The user can also zoom
                        in and out with the scroll wheel. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Unisex Bathroom Search is a project that is very near and
                        dear to me. As a non-binary UGA student it's helpful to have
                        the unisex bathrooms scattered throughout campus. There is a
                        public pdf for all the unisex bathrooms on campus, however it
                        isn't super navigable, especially for actually finding the
                        bathrooms in the buildings. For that, I had to cross-reference
                        the floor maps in an even more unnavigable site. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By January 2024, I had enough and started writing a simple html
                        site for the unisex bathrooms in the buildings for my classes.
                        Then I had an idea; why not just do it for every building? I
                        can make a searchable list for each building and highlight all
                        the unisex bathrooms in their respective maps. I used a software
                        to turn the PDF maps into PNGs and highlighted each of the unisex
                        bathrooms with a painting program. Each PNG was given a proper
                        indexable filename. I then took the bathroom list PDF and imported 
                        the table into Microsoft Excel. With Excel, I exported the data
                        as a CSV which was then converted (with the power of notepad++
                        and regular expressions) to a json. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Writing the site was a bit of a chore, but I managed to get
                        a searchable list that updates a table with the input box.
                        Visual Studio Code simplifies things enough. I had a spare
                        computer and set up Ubuntu Server on it so that I could host
                        the site. I set up SSH on the computer and a GitHub repository
                        so that I can easily update the site if needed. I used CloudFlare
                        to get a domain name and an SSL so that I can easily access
                        it when I'm away from home.

                    <p>
                        This project was intended just for me, but I quickly realized
                        that others can use it too! I cleaned up the html and the styles
                        as recommended by friends. I then put it on GitHub Pages so that
                        it's much more stable in case of a power outage. This has reached
                        beyond my inner friends and I am happy to say that this project
                        has helped many individuals.
