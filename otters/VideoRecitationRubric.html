<p>Ethical questions are inherently subjective, but that does not mean you can just blather anything that comes into your head. Just as with your technical projects, there are recognized methodologies for ethical reasoning. Your grade in this course will reflect how well you have mastered these methodologies. Success will not only help you make better ethical decisions in your work and life, but empower you to persuade others. <strong>For this course, you are required to record and post multiple 1:30 -- 3:00 minute recitation videos that define (i.e., state a <em>thesis</em>) and defend (i.e., construct an <em>argument</em>) an ethical point of view on a prompt/topic that adheres to <em>one</em> of the five workable ethical theories discusses in the textbook.</strong> Specifically, you are limited to: Kantianism, act utilitarianism, rule utilitarianism, social contract theory, and virtue ethics.</p>
<p>In general, a <i>recitation</i> is defined as, "the action of repeating something aloud from memory;" however, <strong>for the purposes of this class, a <em>recitation video</em> is to be interpreted as a video of you responding to a prompt within the guidelines of this rubric.</strong> As such, you need to physically appear in the video in such a way that each of the criterion groups can be evaluated. If you have any questions about this, then please ask the course instructor.</p>
<p>In general, the grade you receive for a recitation will be based on an aggregate evaluation of how clearly you define and defend your argument as well as how well you present yourself. Here is the general rubric that will be used when providing feedback:</p>
<table class="table"><caption>Recitation Video Rubric</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Category</th>
<th scope="col">Unacceptable (0)</th>
<th scope="col">Marginal (3)</th>
<th scope="col">Acceptable (4)</th>
<th scope="col">Exceptional (5)</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Thesis</th>
<td>No thesis.</td>
<td>A thesis is discernible but is partially stated and/or not clearly stated.</td>
<td>The thesis is clearly stated and includes the ethical point of view being taken as well as the ethical theory that will be used in the argument.</td>
<td>The thesis is clearly stated and includes the ethical point of view being taken as well as the ethical theory that will be used in the argument. Additionally, a very brief outline of the argument is presented that makes sense in the context of the recitation's introduction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Argument</th>
<td>No argument or an invalid argument is presented that does not adhere to one of the five workable ethical theories.</td>
<td>An argument is presented, however, it does not adhere to the ethical theory stated in or discerned from the the thesis.</td>
<td>The argument clearly adheres to the the ethical theory stated in the thesis. That is, the argument reaches its conclusion using the stated ethical theory.</td>
<td>The argument clearly adheres to the the ethical theory stated in the thesis. Additionally, the argument is constructed such that each piece very clearly flows from the evidence to the conclusion using the stated ethical theory without leaps or gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Evidence / Support</th>
<td>No evidence or support for the argument is provided.</td>
<td>Speculative. Assertions are made about what the evidence would show, if one were actually to look at it; however, the argument appeals to evidence that has not actually been collected, does not actually exist, or is merely posited.</td>
<td>The argument appeals to clearly relevant evidence from at least one reputable source. Most of the hypothetical positions in the argument are supported with evidence that compels the audience to accept any claims.</td>
<td>The argument appeals to clearly relevant evidence from two or more reputable sources. All of the hypothetical positions in the argument are supported with evidence that compels the audience to accept any claims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Presentation</th>
<td>Does not meet any of the criteria for a better presentation score. Videos that are not an <a href="#" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" title="Unmanufactured Continuous Shot" data-content="The submitted video is one long, unedited take by a single camera. That is, while the video itself may be one of many takes, it is not the result of combining multiple takes using software or some other method.">unmanufactured continuous shot</a>, violations of the "Video Dress Code Policy" stated in the syllabus, or shorter than 1:30 in length automatically fall into this criterion level.</td>
<td>The presentation contains multiple elements that distract from the argument. These distractions include, but are not limited to: shaky camera, low volume and/or monotonous tone, use of slang, mispronunciation and/or inconsistent pronunciation, <a href="#" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" title="Excessive Filler" data-content="In linguistics, a filler is a sound or word that is spoken in conversation by one participant to signal to others a pause to think without giving the impression of having finished speaking. In English, the most common filler sounds are &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;uh&quot;, &quot;er&quot;, &quot;um&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;you know&quot;, &quot;I mean&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;actually&quot;, &quot;basically&quot;, and &quot;right&quot;.">excessive filler</a>, minimal eye contact (usually from note reading), and clearly showing no interest in the topic and/or argument.</td>
<td>Avoids most of the pitfalls of a marginal delivery -- very minor exceptions are acceptable. Speaks with satisfactory variation of volume and inflection and shows some enthusiasm about the topic and/or argument.</td>
<td>Avoids all of the pitfalls of an acceptable delivery. Speaks with fluctuation in volume and inflection to maintain audience interest and emphasize key points and demonstrates strong, seemingly honest enthusiasm about the topic during the entire recitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Prompt-Specific Criteria</th>
<td>Does not address specific points or questions mentioned in the prompt, if applicable.</td>
<td>If applicable, addresses some of the specific points or questions mentioned in the prompt.</td>
<td>If applicable, addresses all of the specific points or questions mentioned in the prompt.</td>
<td>If applicable, addresses specific points or questions mentioned in the prompt in a clear, concise manner that feels like a part of the overall delivery and not something that was just tacked on.</td>
